# ConvSort
Using CNNs to sort numbers!

This repo contains two implementations of CNN-based sorting models. Before diving into the models, be sure to install the proper dependencies: `pip install requirements.txt`

The first model is inspired by the classic Merge Sort algorithm. You can test it as follows: `python merge_sort.py`.

The second model is inspired by the Seq2Seq architecture for neural machine translation. Similarly, you can test it as follows: `python conv_seq2seq.py`.

Please refer to ConvNet_Sort.pdf for the theory and justification behind each model.
